        <h2>Instructions on how to update our contributors page.</h2>
        <p>
          Feel free to give suggestions on how we can maximize the use of the
          contributors page for updating our accomplishments and also to give credit
          to those who have worked to make this site happen. I am also hoping that
          you can include this site in your portfolio. Really excited to have you
          here.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          Please feel free to add your name in the table everytime you add and do
          some tasks in building the website. For us to practice our HTML and CSS skills, you can add information about your 
          contribution through editing the
          actual html and the table content. Please indicate the date you added your
          changes and contribution together with the task that you have
          accomplished during the day. You can use the same message you made when
          you commited your changes to the site.
