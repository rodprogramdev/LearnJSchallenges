        <p>Hi! I am rodprogramdev (x3rima) and I would like to welcome you to this project and hopefully 
            we can practice collaboration in building this site through github.   I am planning to use SASS in building the pages and hopefully we can collaborate through 
            working on each part of the site. I'm also thinking about using BEM as the CSS naming convention so that 
            it will be easier to work on each components for scalability. If you have any suggestions feel free to inform me, I'd love to hear from you.
           
        </p>
        
        <p>The site hopes to help total beginners who are learning JavaScript through providing them information 
            about how to code using JavaScript.You can read through some instructions for you to be able to further understand the different keywords and
            syntax used in JavaScript. This site is open for contributors who wants to learn through doing, everyone is encourage
            to participate in building the site while creating different sections and pages that can 
            showcase the knowledge that they would want to share to others through forms of challenges and 
            exercises. 
        
        </p>

        
     
        <p class="intro__last-paragraph">
            Suggestions for ideas on how to work with the site and improve it is higlhly appreciated. I am also new to collaboration in 
            using github so this will really be a great help for me to learn more on how to work with others through
            github and I am also hoping that we can learn together.
